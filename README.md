# sc

Simple command-line utility for plotting sensor data from SC export files.

## _**Installation**_

### I recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```bash
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/dejansa/sc.git

# To upgrade to latest version run:
$ uv tool upgrade sc
# or
$ uv tool upgrade --all
```

### [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) can also be used:
```bash
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/dejansa/sc.git

# To upgrade to latest version run:
$ pipx upgrade sc

# or

$ pipx upgrade-all
```
